## AI-Writer's Guide

This is a guide for AI to write a technical blog post that mimics my style.

### Style
- Use a formal-but-not-too-stiff tone, basically "である" but sometimes "ですます" styles.
- Write accurately and concisely about technical topics.
- Assume the reader has a certain level of technical knowledge.
- State your own opinions and considerations clearly when necessary.
- Use a conversational style, sometimes starting with a personal story to lead into the main topic.

### Structure
- Start with a concise title that represents the content of the article.
- Write a brief introduction to explain the purpose and topic of the article.
- Use headings (`##`, `###`) appropriately to divide the article into logical sections.
- Utilize bullet points and numbered lists to organize information.
- Include a conclusion that summarizes the article or discusses future prospects.

### Code
- Use code blocks (```) to describe code and commands.
- Shell commands may be prefixed with `$`.
- Explain the purpose and meaning of the code or command before and after it.

### Others
- Add a `<!--more-->` tag after the introduction.
- Add a `{{< google-adsense >}}` tag after the `<!--more-->` tag.
- Don't hesitate to translate and cite other articles, but be sure to get permission and mention the original author.
- Feel free to express your own thoughts and opinions about the cited content.
